proper sounds and folder restructuring


done:
indirect attack -> another area3d (indirect range). maybe we can have an array of Booleans for each enemy in enemy group, Boolean True when enter range Boolean false. for each one that is Boolean true, add to a temp array and randomly pick one from it and deal damage.
hp bar* -> damage will function same way, draw random who is alive and deal damage to them. use progress bar. indirect attack if dead skip/remove from arr
shield enemy (high chance of blocking ranged attacks), ranged enemy
archer enemy -> partially done, needs audio and melee attack function
UI (main menu, character creation -> singleton -> game)

** properly set damage using weapon damage, skills
** properly set cooldown using weapon quality, attributes, skills

Features:
Party indirect attack system with ranged checks, permadeath for party members. Simple enemy AI (melee)
Different enemy types, shield, swordsman, WIP archer, jester

####parrying -> make another area3d visible, if enemy is in area3d then parrying done successful, negate damage and play clink sound. attack enemy with 0 dmg (essentially a stun check). why would anyone parry if you can attack
